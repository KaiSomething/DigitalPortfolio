                <a>This is probably one of my favorite projects. Its a fighting game where you use french insults to deal damage. 
                    I made it as an assignment for my grade 11 french class in around 1 month. It supports online multiplayer with a code system to join lobbies.
                    I think the reason I love this project so much is because it can be used in an educational environment, 
                    and seeing my project being used to help others is really nice. Unfortunatly, I cant afford to keep the servers running myself, 
                    so the game is not playable at the moment.
                    <br><br>
                    Just as a side note, this game was not originally written in Javascript. I just compiled a web version. It was made using <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker" target="_blank" class="link">GameMaker</a>.
                    Which uses a language called GML, which is very similar to Javascript, but with some minor differences.
